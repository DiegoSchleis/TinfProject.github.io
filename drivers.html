            <h2 class="headline">Drivers</h2>
            <p class="text">Every team in Formula One must run two cars in every session in a Grand Prix weekend, and
                every
                team may use
                up to four drivers in a season. A team may also run two additional drivers in Free Practice
                sessions, which are often used to test potential new drivers for a career as a Formula One driver or
                gain experienced drivers to evaluate the car. Most modern drivers are contracted for at least the
                duration of a season, with driver changes taking place in between seasons, in comparison to early years
                where drivers often competed at an ad hoc basis from race to race. Each competitor must be in the
                possession
                of a FIA Super Licence to compete in a Grand Prix, which is issued to drivers who have met the criteria
                of success in junior motorsport categories and having achieved 300 kilometres (190 mi) of running in a
                Formula One car. Drivers may also be issued a Super Licence by the World Motor Sport Council if they
                fail to
                meet the criteria. Teams also contract test and reserve drivers, to stand in for regular drivers when
                necessary and develop the team's car; although with the reduction on testing the reserve drivers' role
                mainly takes places on a simulator, such as rFactor Pro, which is used by most of the F1
                teams. Although most drivers earn their seat on ability, commercial considerations also come into
                play with teams having to satisfy sponsors and financial demands.</p>
            <p class="text">Each driver chooses an unassigned number from 2–99 (excluding 17) upon entering Formula One,
                and keeps that number during their time in the series. The number one is reserved for the reigning
                driver's
                champion, who retains their previous number and may choose to use it instead of the number one. At the
                onset of the championship, numbers were allocated by race organisers on an ad-hoc basis from race to
                race,
                and competitors did not have a permanent number throughout the season. Permanent numbers were introduced
                in 1973, when teams were allocated numbers in ascending order based upon the constructors standings. The
                teams would hold those numbers from season to season with the exception of the team with the world
                drivers
                champion, which would swap its n
                were allocated spare numbers, the onethumbers and two of the previous champion's team. New
                entrantsr l with the exception of withe number 13 which had been unused since 1976. As
                teams kept their numbers foong periods of time car numbers became associated with a team, such as
                Ferrari's 27 and 28. A differewas designatednt system was used from 1996 to 2013. At the start of each
                season, the
                current drivers champion number one, his team-mate number two, and the rest of the teams
                assigned ascending numbers according to previous season's constructors' championship order.</p>

            <h2 class="headline">Driver Equipment</h2>
            <h3 class="minorheadline">Clothing</h3>
            <figure class="piccontainer flt-right">
                <img id="suit" src="img/Suit.png">
                <figcaption>Red Bull's F1 suit of 2016</figcaption>

            <p class="driverequipment">
                Since 1975 the FIA has required that driver clothing be flame retardant so as to offer protection in the
                event of a fire. That used to mean heavy, five layer, NASA-spec race suits. Nowadays the key is Nomex®,
                a
                fire-resistant, lightweight artificial fibre which undergoes thermal testing in the laboratory. It is
                subjected to an open flame with a temperature of 300 to 400 degrees Celsius that acts on the material
                from a
                distance of three centimetres - only if it fails to ignite within 10 seconds can it be used in a
                driver’s
                overalls.
                The modern driver’s race suit (also worn by pit crews) features elastic cuffs on wrists and ankles and
                is
                made of two to four layers of Nomex®. A completed multi layered overall undergoes 15 washings as well as
                a
                further 15 dry cleaning processes before it is finally tested. It is then subjected to a temperature of
                600
                to 800 degrees Celsius. The critical level of 841 degrees Celsius may not be exceeded inside the overall
                for
                at least 11 seconds.
                The zip on the suit must also be able to withstand the same temperatures and must not melt or transfer
                heat
                close to the driver's skin. Even the thread used to sew it together must be fire resistant, as must any
                patches, although the majority of sponsor logos are now printed on - a change that has helped cut the
                weight
                of overalls by over half a kilo in the past few years. But not only are modern race suits light, they’re
                also breathable to in order to allow the several kilos of sweat produced by the driver during a race to
                escape.

            <h3 class="minorheadline">Helmet</h3>
            <p class="driverequipment">
                Crash helmets have been compulsory in Formula One racing since 1953, but like F1 cars, their design and
                construction have evolved enormously since then. Nevertheless, head and neck trauma remains the greatest
                single injury risk to drivers.

                To counter that risk a modern F1 helmet must be supremely light - around 1250 grams is the norm - and
                strong. The lighter the helmet, the less weight it adds to the driver’s head under the extreme G-forces
                experienced in accelerating/braking/cornering, hence the smaller the risk of whiplash-type injuries. And
                the stronger the helmet, the greater its ability to absorb impacts and resist penetration during a
                crash.

                Only helmets authorized by the FIA may be used in races. To ensure they meet the strict safety standards
                required, Formula One helmets are subjected to extreme deformation and fragmentation tests. To pass the
                tests the helmet is made principally of carbon fibre, polyethylene and fire-resistant aramide, and is
                constructed in several layers.

                The outer shell has two layers, typically fibre-reinforced resin over carbon fibre. Under that comes a
                layer of aramid (usually Kevlar®, the same material used in many bullet-proof vests). Then there is a
                softer, deformable layer made from polyethylene (a plastic based on polystyrene), covered with the same
                flame-proof material used in the driver’s overalls.The helmet’s visor is made of a special clear
                polycarbonate, combining excellent impact protection with flame resistance and excellent visibility.
                Most drivers use tinted visors, the insides of which are coated with anti-fogging chemicals to prevent
                them misting up, particularly in wet conditions. Several transparent tear-off strips are attached to the
                outside. As the visor picks up dirt during the course of the race, the driver can remove these to clear
                his vision. Ventilation for the driver is provided by small air intakes in the helmet. These include
                filters to prevent small particles of track debris entering.
