                <p>A Formula One car is a single-seat, open cockpit, open-wheel racing car with substantial front
                    and rear wings,
                    and an engine positioned behind the driver, intended to be used in competition at Formula One racing
                    events.
                    The
                    regulations governing the cars are unique to the championship. The Formula One regulations specify
                    that cars
                    must be constructed by the racing teams themselves, though the design and manufacture can be
                    outsourced.The
                    modern-day Formula One cars are constructed from composites of carbon fibre and similar
                    ultra-lightweight
                    materials. The minimum weight permissible is 702 kg (1,548 lb) including the driver but not fuel.
                    Cars are
                    weighed with dry-weather tyres fitted.</p>

                <p>Every team in Formula One must run two cars in every session in a Grand Prix weekend, and every
                    team may use
                    up to four drivers in a season. A team may also run two additional drivers in Free Practice
                    sessions, which are often used to test potential new drivers for a career as a Formula One driver or
                    gain experienced drivers to evaluate the car. Most modern drivers are contracted for at least the
                    duration of a season, with driver changes taking place in between seasons, in comparison to early
                    years
                    where drivers often competed at an ad hoc basis from race to race...</p>

                <p> Published on 19th August 2016, F1 2016 is the latest edition of the F1 game series published and
                    developed
                    by Codemasters. It is obviously based on real life Formula One and is the best F1 simulator ever
                    published.
                    The
                    game has stunning graphics combined with the best and most realistic car handle ever. It also has a
                    very
                    deep "career-mode" that can last over ten years(not real-life years). Additionally F1 2016 has an
                    online
                    mode with matchmaking in case the AI-drivers are too easy for you.</p>
