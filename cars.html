        <h2 class="headline">Cars</h2>
        <p class="text">A Formula One car is a single-seat, open cockpit, open-wheel racing car with substantial front
            and rear wings,
            and an engine positioned behind the driver, intended to be used in competition at Formula One racing events.
            The
            regulations governing the cars are unique to the championship. The Formula One regulations specify that cars
            must be constructed by the racing teams themselves, though the design and manufacture can be outsourced.The
            modern-day Formula One cars are constructed from composites of carbon fibre and similar ultra-lightweight
            materials. The minimum weight permissible is 702 kg (1,548 lb) including the driver but not fuel. Cars are
            weighed with dry-weather tyres fitted. Prior to the 2014 F1 season, cars often weighed in under this
            limit so teams added ballast in order to add weight to the car. The advantage of using ballast is that it
            can be placed anywhere in the car to provide ideal weight distribution. This can help lower the car's centre
            of gravity to improve stability and also allows the team to fine-tune the weight distribution of the car to
            suit individual circuits. </p>

        <p class="text">The 2006 Formula One season saw the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile
            (FIA) introduce a then-new engine formula, which mandated cars to be powered by 2. 4-litre naturally
            aspirated engines in the V8 engine configuration, with no more than four valves per cylinder. Further
            technical restrictions, such as a ban on variable intake trumpets, have also been introduced with the new
            2.4 L V8 formula to prevent the teams from achieving higher RPM and horsepower too quickly. The 2009 season
            limited engines to 18,000 rpm in order to improve engine reliability and cut costs.

            For a decade, F1 cars had run with 3.0-litre naturally aspirated V10 engines; however, development had led
            to these engines producing between 980 and 1,000 hp (730 and 750 kW), and the cars reaching top speeds of
            375 km/h (233 mph) (Jacques Villeneuve with Sauber-Ferrari) on the Monza circuit.[citation needed] Teams
            started to use exotic alloys in the late 1990s, leading to the FIA banning the use of exotic materials in
            engine construction, with only aluminium, titanium and iron alloys being allowed for the pistons, cylinders,
            connecting rods and crankshafts. The FIA has continually enforced material and design restrictions to
            limit power. Even with the restrictions, the V10s in the 2005 season were reputed to develop 980 hp (730
            kW), power levels not seen since the ban on turbo-charged engines in 1989.

            The lesser funded teams (the former Minardi team spends less than 50 million, while Ferrari spent hundreds
            of millions of euros a year developing their car) had the option of keeping the current V10 for another
            season, but with a rev limiter to keep them competitive with the most powerful V8 engines. The only team to
            take this option was the Toro Rosso team, which was the reformed and regrouped Minardi.

            The engines consume around 450 l (15.9 ft3) of air per second. Race fuel consumption rate is normally
            around 75 l/100 km travelled (3.1 US mpg, 3.8 imp mpg, 1.3 km/l).

            All cars have the engine located between the driver and the rear axle. The engines are a stressed member in
            most cars, meaning that the engine is part of the structural support framework, being bolted to the cockpit
            at the front end, and transmission and rear suspension at the back end.

            In the 2004 championship, engines were required to last a full race weekend. For the 2005 championship, they
            were required to last two full race weekends and if a team changes an engine between the two races, they
            incur a penalty of 10 grid positions. In 2007, this rule was altered slightly and an engine only had to last
            for Saturday and Sunday running. This was to promote Friday running. In the 2008 season, engines were
            required to last two full race weekends; the same regulation as the 2006 season. However, for the 2009
            season, each driver is allowed to use a maximum of 8 engines over the season, meaning that a couple of
            engines have to last three race weekends. This method of limiting engine costs also increases the importance
            of tactics, since the teams have to choose which races to have a new or an already-used engine.

            As of the 2014 season, all F1 cars have been equipped with turbocharged 1.6-litre V6 engines. Turbochargers
            have been banned since 1988. This change may give an improvement of up to 29% fuel efficiency. One of the
            many reasons that Mercedes dominated the season early, was due to the placement of the turbocharger's
            compressor at one side of the engine, and the turbine at the other; both were then linked by a shaft
            travelling through the vee of the engine. The benefit is that air is not traveling through as much pipework,
            in turn reducing turbo lag and increases efficiency of the car. In addition, it means that the air moving
            through the compressor is much cooler as it is further away from the hot turbine section.</p>
